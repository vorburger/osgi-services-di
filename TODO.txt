* manual tests, coming and going

* better Generics simply by doing fixed variants for 1,2,3..7 dependencies! 

* register not as method on ServiceRegistry but on new interface passed into Callback, to track reg and auto unreg ?

* Guava binding

* run this by some people and see what they think about it - worth pursuing?

* service integration tests (easy to write)

* ServiceRequirement set/isMultiple, and handle in OsgiServiceRegistry use getServices() instead of getService(), and null check each entry

* bundle coming and going integration tests, incl. itself (harder to write) 

* TODOs

* LOW [SZ] Is it somehow possible to use generics in ServiceRegistry and have the List<?> of ServiceRequirementsAvailableCallback#provide() match List<ServiceRequirement> requirements if that was a List<ServiceRequirement<T>> ?
